## 2026-09-25T16:30:23.3327292Z — Build Foundation v5 Canary 1

- Revision: 1
- Source checkpoint: `8995d572ef5317779e49a896e6ca663b128a6508`
- Changes: Produced Foundation v5 from immutable Foundation v4. The three Minecraft 26.2 item definitions redirect only `enderscape:veiled_leaves`, `mynx_trees:silver_birch_leaves`, and `mynx_trees:wisteria_leaves` to their already-present Foundation bushy block models. Silver Birch preserves its exact upstream constant item tint; Veiled and Wisteria preserve their untinted behavior. Blockstates, block models, textures, and all unrelated resources remain source-identical.
- Build/static: JSON parsing, target item/model/texture-chain resolution, exact tint assertions, CRC validation, root-layout validation, and entry-by-entry v4-to-v5 diff validation passed. No Minecraft runtime validation was performed.
- Runtime: RUNTIME_UNTESTED.
- Artifact: `Foundation v5.zip`; SHA-256 `70178c497995083e6331d6412395d5b89039e60535877d14cc52cf5cf988ba80`; finalized `2026-09-25T16:30:23.3327292Z`.
- Result: ACTIVE / STATIC_PASS / RUNTIME_UNTESTED.
- Next state: Retain this exact local artifact and perform the targeted manual item-preview checks in TESTING.md before any owner acceptance decision.
